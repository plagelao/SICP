Yes! I'm starting SICP again :) But this time is for real. I'm joining [Enrique Comba](http://twitter.com/ecomba)'s [study group](http://ecomba.org/study), and I'm commited to it.

The study group is starting tomorrow. It is going to be in Madrid, but they accept "outsiders". I'm not going to be able to attend the first meeting, but I'm going to write a post about what I've learned while reading the [Section 1.1](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#%_sec_1.1) of the book soon (tomorrow).

Join us! It is going to be very funny.
