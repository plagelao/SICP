This section is not easy for me. It is about orders of growth, a concept that I have never understand completely. Do not get me wrong, I know the meaning and I know the diferences between &theta;(n) and &theta;(1). What I do not understand is how to calculate it. I think I am going to know how to do it much better after this.

Let's have a look at the exercises for this section:

- Exercise 1.14 Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of [section 1.2.2](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.2) in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

  First of all, I'm going to show you the procedure the exercise is talking about:

          (define (count-change amount)
            (cc amount 5))
          (define (cc amount kinds-of-coins)
           (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
                 ((or (< amount 0) (= kinds-of-coins 0)) 0)
                 (else (+ (cc amount
                          (- kinds-of-coins 1))
                          (cc (- amount
                                 (first-denomination kinds-of-coins))
                              kinds-of-coins)))))
          (define (first-denomination kinds-of-coins)
           (cond ((= kinds-of-coins 1) 1)
                 ((= kinds-of-coins 2) 5)
                 ((= kinds-of-coins 3) 10)
                 ((= kinds-of-coins 4) 25)
                 ((= kinds-of-coins 5) 50)))

  Let's see how it works for 11 cents:

                                                                   (cc 11 5)
                                                                    /     \

                                                              /       \
                                                       (cc 11 3)      (cc -14 4)

  And yes, after all this calculations, the answer is 4 O_o.
  So, coming back to the original questions. What is the order of growth of the space? Although I am really bad at this, I think order of growth of the space is the easy one. We always need to calculate the combination where all the change is made of pennies (Which is the biggest branch in the tree), so it is &theta;(n).
  What is the order of grow of the number of steps? No idea :( I need some help with this. I know is not linear because it depends on the number of kind of coins used... I also know that it is linear for n < 5. Any clue?

- Exercise 1.15 The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x  x if x is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

        sin x = 3 sin(x/3) - 4sin^3(x/3)

  to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered ``sufficiently small'' if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

        (define (cube x) (* x x x))
        (define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
        (define (sine angle)
          (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
              angle
              (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

  a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

    The procedure p is evaluated 5 times. If we do 12.15/3 we get 4 and a reminder of 0.15, which is greater than 0.1, so we need to do p again. That makes 5 times.

  b.  What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

    The order of growth is the same in space and in  number of steps. Since we are using (/ angle 3), we only increase the space and the number of steps if the new angle is three times the old one. That mades it &theta;(log n).


And that is all for today. I am really bad calculating any order of growth.
